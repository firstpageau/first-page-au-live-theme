				<h2>Your business is losing money and market-share every day that you aren’t running ads on Instagram</h2>
				<p>Here’s a shocking statistic...</p>
				<p>More than 500 million people use Instagram EVERY DAY - many of which spend over an hour a day on the app.</p>
				<p>Because of this, it’s easy to understand why running Instagram ads are a no-brainer for your business. You want to market your business in places where people are investing their attention - and few platforms have the attention (and reach) that IG has.
				</p>
				<p>Still not convinced? Here’s some more must-know data about marketing on Instagram…</p>
				<ul>
					<li>90% of people on Instagram follow at least one business</li>
					<li>50% of users are more interested in a brand once they see an ad on Instagram</li>
					<li>81% of people use Instagram to research products and services</li>
					<li>Over 2 billion businesses now market on Instagram</li>
				</ul>
				<p>And to take it a step further, Instagram’s remarketing features are a dream for advertisers. This powerful technology allows you to create an optimised funnel that caters to every step of your customer journey, enabling you to double, or triple your sales, in record time.
				</p>
				<p>So no matter what your business sells, Instagram ads are the key to introducing your brand to a whole new market of customers and sales.</p>

							<div itemprop="text" class="card-body">
								<p>If your brand is looking to reach its customers with a greater strike rate, Instagram ads are how you can make it happen. As these highly visual ads look much the same as regular posts, these online advertisements appear in several high-profile positions, including the Feed, Stories, Explore and more. With several different ad formats to choose from, you can closely align your campaign with your business objectives, giving you a great chance of experiencing a top ROI.</p>

								<p>With Instagram featuring well over a billion active monthly users, planning and implementing a detailed campaign can deliver your business a massive amount of leads. As the nature of Instagram ads gives you a fantastic opportunity to showcase your brand’s personality, you can drive more followers to your profile and get them to take action on your posts. Whether you design an entire Instagram ad campaign or promote a recent post from in-app, the rewards can be simply incredible.</p>

							<div itemprop="text" class="card-body">
								<p>Part of the appeal of an Instagram ad campaign is that it’s remarkably easy for brands operating at every scale to get started. The first thing you need to do is connect your Facebook page to your Instagram account before heading to the Facebook Business Manager dashboard to fine-tune your approach. Alongside a clear understanding of your budget and your campaign goals, set an appropriate objective and enter the details of your ad set.</p>

								<p>Next, you’ll have to think carefully about your targeting. Depending on the demographics of your ideal target market, you can position your campaign to reach users based on their location, interests, behaviours and more. After uploading your optimised creative, you can submit your advertisement for approval. But this isn’t the end of your campaign. You should also install the Facebook pixel on your website, which ensures you can track website traffic and target them with remarketing strategies.</p>

							<div itemprop="text" class="card-body">
								<p>Instagram is not only one of the biggest social media platforms in the entire world, it’s also home to a wonderfully engaged user base that spends loads of time on the platform. In fact, Instagram users spend an estimated 30 minutes every day scrolling the feed, while 81% of the people use Instagram to research new products and services. This means your business has the chance to reach new audiences and level the playing field with a comprehensive advertising campaign.
								</p>
								<p>No matter what demographics and audiences you’re trying to convert, Instagram ads can be carefully targeted to a precise customer base that cares about your products and services. With businesses across virtually every industry able to develop content that skyrockets their brand awareness, achieving your marketing goals is made simple with an expert-led Instagram advertising campaign. As the team at First Page can deliver outstanding experimentation and analysis while controlling your budget, outgrowing your rivals is within reach.</p>

						<div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer" id="collapse4" class="collapse">
							<div itemprop="text" class="card-body">
								<p>Instagram ads deliver outstanding results for businesses because they can be targeted to a remarkably precise customer base. By developing detailed personas of your ideal audience, you can push the platform’s features to the limit. For example, location-based targeting allows brands to reach consumers based on their country, state, postcode or even a specific address radius. This means businesses can target local consumers who live within touching distance of their brick-and-mortar storefront, driving more customers to visit and make a purchase.</p>
								<p>Brands can also target Instagram ads based on age, gender and language, helping you reach a customer base that fits neatly within your established audience personas. As Instagram keeps track of what kind of content users engage with on the platform, interest-based targeting is great for attracting an audience that has displayed a fascination with like-minded businesses. Finally, behaviour-based targeting ensures you can capitalise on potential customers who have purchased similar products or have certain device usage traits.</p>

						<div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer" id="collapse5" class="collapse">
							<div itemprop="text" class="card-body">
								<p>Since Instagram was acquired by Facebook in 2012, many business owners struggle to choose between these social media platforms for their advertising needs. With campaigns for both platforms organised through the Facebook Ads Manager, some similarities ensure reaching your target market across either site is possible. Yet there are even more differences that mean you’ll want to think carefully about which campaign makes sense before you invest your hard-earned cash.</p>

								<p>Instagram is hugely popular amongst young adults and teens compared to Facebook. If you have a product aimed at this target market, Instagram ads might end up being the smarter choice, with custom and lookalike campaigns proven to be highly effective. Meanwhile, Facebook has an even larger reach, so businesses seeking maximum brand awareness may opt for this platform instead. However, Instagram engagement is unmatched for brands with visual products that benefit most from 15-60 second video ads and compelling branded content.</p>

						</div>
						<div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer" id="collapse6" class="collapse">
							<div itemprop="text" class="card-body">
								<p>When you set up an Instagram advertising campaign, the standard approach is to target your audience based on specific demographic or psychographic filters like interests and past behaviour. However, brands can also choose to create their own custom audience from a private source of information. For example, a custom audience on Instagram can be based on website traffic, a certain app activity or previous engagement with your content. As these people have already displayed an interest in your business, reaching them with targeted advertisements can deliver amazing results.</p>

								<p>To get started, you’ll need to prepare your customer database in advance. This is because your custom audience information needs to include so-called “identifiers”, which includes snippets of personal data such as a photo number, email address or home address. After making sure you’ve input this information correctly, you can submit your custom audience through the Facebook Business Manager and wait for confirmation that it’s ready to go.

							<div itemprop="text" class="card-body">
								<p>Instagram is beloved by brands around the world because numerous engaging advertising formats open up your digital marketing possibilities. Standard in-feed image ads appear as single posts in the feed, while video ads can run for up to 60 minutes now that IGTV ads have been reworked. If you’re looking to showcase more of your product or brand, carousel ads allow creators to upload up to 10 images or videos that users can swipe through in a single post. Shopping ads have also become a highly productive outlet for brands wanting to boost conversions.
								</p>
								<p>With these ads linking users to a description page inside the app, they can checkout through your mobile website. Collection ads are closely aligned with shopping ads, presenting users with numerous images or videos that compel people to purchase. There are also Explore ads, which appear on the Explore tab alongside a specific user’s personalised content. Finally, advertising on Instagram Reels – the platform’s answer to TikTok – showcases your brand in a new full-screen and wonderfully interactive section of the app.</p>

							<div itemprop="text" class="card-body">
								<p>One of the most effective ways to connect with a new customer base is by making the most of the lookalike audience feature. This tool enables brands to find new consumers who have similar demographics, interests and behaviours to their existing audience.

							<div itemprop="text" class="card-body">
								<p>Launching a highly optimised Instagram ad strategy is a great way to level up your operation. But every brand must understand that the cost of delivering a campaign objective depends on a wide variety of factors that make determining an exact final cost a challenging prospect. For example, converting users in a competitive niche such as beauty, fitness or fashion typically requires higher investment than sectors where fewer brands fight for attention.</p>
								<p>The two main Instagram advertising bid strategies are cost-per-click (CPC) and cost-per-impression (CPM). If you’re looking to drive conversions, the most cost-effective solution for your budget is to use CPC, as you won’t pay for users that simply come across your ad on their feed. However, CPM is ideal for generating the most attention for your brand. By monitoring metrics like click-through rates and cost-per-engagement (CPE), you’ll receive insight that makes adjusting your campaign more precise.

								<p>Instagram doesn’t currently offer a built-in strategy for boosting your follower count. However, you can still develop a powerful campaign that reaches your Instagram audience and introduces them to your brand. Naturally, you have to target users that display a clear interest in your products and services. This requires you to focus your Instagram ads campaign on users that share similar interests and behaviours with your existing audience.</p>
								<p>With a robust idea about which Instagram users will most likely engage with your posts and take action, achieving enviable success means you have to match advertising content to your audience. From the messaging you craft in your ad's description to the images or videos you share, everything must be tailored to your precise customer base to skyrocket your follower count. With the help of First Page’s Instagram ads experts, we can personalise a campaign that exceeds your expectations.</p>

								<p>Launching into an Instagram ads campaign has a high chance of delivering big results for your business. But you must keep a sharp eye on how your strategy is performing to ensure your investment creates the biggest bang for your buck. Fortunately, numerous eye-opening metrics make it easy to understand how your brand is achieving its campaign objectives. Head to Facebook Ads Manager to receive keen insight into how your ad strategy is progressing.</p>
								<p>So which metrics should you consider most? It depends on your goals. However, engagement rate is a clear signal about whether your campaign is hitting the mark, as more likes, comments and saves mean people care about what you have to say. If you’re most interested in conversions, measuring the click-through rate of your ads is vital, while audience demographics can be considered alongside your customer personas. By constantly analysing your campaign, you can forecast for the future and boost your return on investment.</p>

								<p>Leading brands around the world love Instagram ads because they can take charge of their own approach. With the entire campaign organised through Facebook Business Manager, designing and executing an attention-grabbing strategy is an easily accessible process when you have the required expertise. By understanding your ideal target market and knowing how to reach them through high-end content production, valuable customers will take action on your advertisements when you hit the bullseye with your messaging.</p>
								<p>However, this process is easier said than done. Considering how Instagram has quickly become one of the go-to platforms for the world’s top brands looking to capture the attention of their customers, finding a way to compete is difficult when you lack experience in optimising an ad campaign.

								<p>There’s no doubt that Google ads and Instagram ads are incredible for reaching and converting customers. While these services might sound similar on the surface, there are actually countless small differences that likely signal one is the better choice for you. For example, Google has the largest reach of any ad network in the world, meaning it’s a stellar option for generating sheer brand awareness. However, brands with visual products might find their campaigns resonate with younger audiences on Instagram even stronger.</p>
								<p>While the decision ultimately comes down to your campaign objectives and your customers' position in the user journey, figuring out the right approach is difficult for someone without the necessary experience. Instead, choose to work alongside the expert team at First Page. This way, you'll benefit from our agency's expertise from leading thousands of campaigns. As we determine whether push vs pull marketing is the right approach for your brand, our strategy will ensure your business overcomes the competition and skyrockets its success.</p>
