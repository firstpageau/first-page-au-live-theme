				<h2>You want a massive influx of sales starting today? Google Ads are the best way to go…
				</h2>
				<p>Have you ever heard someone say something along the lines of…</p>
				<p>“We tried Google Ads, it didn’t work for us”</p>
				<p>Well, the harsh truth is if someone says this, it means they did their Google Ads the wrong way.
				</p>
				<p>Google Ads are one of the most effective ways of generating high-quality leads and chart-breaking
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											                    sales - all of which can be on autopilot.
				</p>
				<p>No matter if you are a new business looking for your first clients, or an established Enterprise
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											                    looking to turn into an international-sales-machine - Google Ads is the best option.</p>
				<p>Still don’t believe us? Here’s some jaw-dropping statistics about the sheer power that Google Ads
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											                    have…</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Your users are 50% more likely to make a purchase after they click on one of your ads</li>
					<li>Online ads can increase your brand awareness by 80%</li>
					<li>65% of all SME’s are running a PPC campaign</li>
					<li>35% of your users will purchase your product or service within 5 days of searching for it on
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										                        Google
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>But while Google Ads are effective, they are only effective when executed the right way.

									<p>As the biggest paid ads platform in the world, Google Ads ensures businesses across the spectrum attract their target market and boost conversions. By helping companies push their website to the top of the SERP, Google Ads delivers high-quality leads interested in purchasing your products and services. However, a successful PPC strategy requires in-depth planning to ensure your budget doesn’t go to waste. Fortunately, First Page Australia’s talented team has a wealth of experience when it comes to leading powerful cost-per-click campaigns.</p>
									<p>It might sound simple, but countless businesses fail to tailor their PPC campaigns to their company’s specific needs. However, our superior agency’s in-depth understanding of Google’s bidding system means we can identify the ideal keywords and outperform your rivals. As we look to enhance the Quality Score of your advertising strategy through data-driven research and cutting-edge website optimisations, we can attract a precise audience with a high chance of converting.</p>

								<div itemprop="text" class="card-body">
									<p>Setting up your Google Ads campaign is a quick and easy process. But you must implement techniques to carefully manage your campaign if you want your budget to achieve its maximum potential. This means regularly checking on the essential metrics of your Google Ads campaign, including impressions, clicks, costs and click-through rate. If these aren’t living up to your expectations, it might be time to rethink your ad targeting to see if your performance can be improved. However, there are numerous other ways to manage your Google Ads campaign.
									</p>
									<p>For instance, you might be attracting customers to your website, but failing to generate enough conversions. This might mean you have to optimise your landing pages to better achieve your goals. Consider implementing compelling copy and creative to align closer with your objectives and appeal more to your target market. Meanwhile, you should always conduct extensive A/B testing of your ads, plus add negative keywords, to ensure you’re only reaching the most relevant search traffic.</p>

								<div itemprop="text" class="card-body">
									<p>There are several types of Google Ads that might impact the overall success of your campaign. By understanding your goals and how best to reach your target market, you can choose the ideal ad type to match your needs:
									</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Search ads</li>
										<ul>
											<li>Google search ads appear on the search engine results page (SERP) above and below the results. These are typically best for reaching customers interested in buying products today, meaning you can level up your conversions with top-notch copywriting and a great offer.</li>
										</ul>
										<li>Display ads</li>
										<ul>
											<li>Google display ads can be seen across millions of partner websites and applications available on the Google Display Network. As this type of campaign allows businesses to add images, you can capture attention from consumers and boost brand awareness.
											</li>
										</ul>
										<li>Video ads</li>
										<ul>
											<li>As Google is the proud owner of YouTube – the second-most visited website on the internet – you can produce targeted video ads that allow you to reach a highly engaged audience. With several different subcategories of video ads appearing before, during and after content, your business can showcase what’s special about its products and services.</li>
										</ul>
										<li>Google Shopping Ads</li>
										<ul>
											<li>While Google Shopping isn’t an e-commerce platform like eBay or Amazon, it provides consumers with a great way to find online retailers selling products they want. With targeted Google Shopping ads, you can drive customers to your store with a great offer that compels them to take action.</li>
										</ul>
										<li>Retargeting ads</li>
										<ul>
											<li>By adding a Google remarketing tag to your website, businesses can track previous visitors as they move around the internet. As these people have already viewed your products, but decided not to purchase, remarketing ads ensures you re-engage those who have a higher chance of buying. With a carefully placed reminder, gaining a conversion is far more likely.</li>

								<div itemprop="text" class="card-body">
									<p>Every business must recognise that each Google Ads campaign is different. A successful campaign must respond to the precise needs of the client, yet this variable nature means the final cost can fluctuate significantly. For instance, some companies may wish to rank for hugely competitive keywords, leading to higher costs for winning lucrative placements.

By bidding in these auctions, you have a chance of winning and therefore converting consumers who have conducted a relevant search query. However, to achieve a great return on ad spend, you must align your bidding strategy with your business goals.

									<p>Although it might seem intimidating for beginners, getting started with Google Ads is remarkably easy. First, head to ads.google.com to set up your Google Ads account and select ‘Switch to Expert Mode’ to access a more comprehensive range of features. After selecting your campaign goals, you have to choose from six different ad types, including Search, Display, Shopping, Video, App and Smart campaigns. Next, target your audience based on their geographic location and language to reach customers interested in your products and services.
									</p>
									<p>The next step is to set your budget and max bid. Alongside goals for Conversions, Conversion Value, Clicks and Impression Share, there are advanced automated and manual CPC bid strategies that ensure you control your spending. Then, it’s time to select your ad groups and keywords to ensure your campaign reaches the most accurate customer base possible. Alongside these steps, every business needs to develop a landing page that achieves its goals, plus set up conversion tracking to monitor and adjust its advertising approach in the future.</p>

								<div itemprop="text" class="card-body">
									<p>Developing a high-quality online presence is a great decision for your brand’s future. As more customers choose to shop online, you can make sure you capture their attention. But as the online world is more competitive than ever, standing out against your biggest rivals takes more than just a basic website with a few products listed. Instead, rising above marketplace noise requires a laser-targeted approach to Google Ads that ensures you reach your customers and increase brand awareness.</p>
									<p>If you operate an online or brick-and-mortar business that deals with the local market, your Google Ads must be targeted to people who live in your immediate area. This means you can achieve fast results due to highly engaged traffic visiting your e-commerce platform and your physical storefront. Google Ads can also be used for remarketing purposes, which allows you to reconnect with website visitors who have explored your products but decided not to purchase. This can level up your conversion rates beyond expectations.</p>

									<p>Google Ads are widely used amongst online businesses because the platform ensures you can assess and adjust your campaign with highly effective results. However, the wealth of data available makes it difficult for inexperienced users to determine how best to level up their leads and conversions. So, where should you start? Click-through rate is a clear signal about whether your ads are delivering solid results, as this measures the percentage of people that click your ads after viewing them. If results are lacklustre, add more emotion to your copy or enhance your offer.</p>
									<p>Cost-per-conversion is another insightful metric, as it reveals your Google Ads spending divided by the number of conversions achieved. If your budget is going to waste because you’re struggling to attract enough sales, your messaging or targeting might need a rethink. Meanwhile, it’s always a good idea to keep a close eye on analytics like impression share, return on ad spend and cost-per-action. Chat with the team at First Page to learn how we’ll get the most out of your budget.</p>

By keeping tabs on your organic website traffic, and targeting them with a tailored remarketing strategy, you can enhance your sales and skyrocket revenue. In addition, this approach helps you develop more knowledge about how your customers search for and purchase products online. By creatively interpreting data across your SEO and PPC campaigns, achieving top-quality results is within reach.</p>

									<p>Google Ads is perfect for e-commerce businesses looking to reach their target audience.

								<div itemprop="text" class="card-body">
									<p>You might be wondering why a business would want to stop someone from clicking on their ads. However, keep in mind that the cost of targeting highly competitive keywords results in significant spending. This means you want to get the biggest bang from every click. However, experienced operators know that shady competitors can squander a rival’s budget simply by repeatedly clicking on their online advertisements. But is there anything you can do to stop this so-called 'click fraud'? Fortunately, the answer is yes! Google has implemented a range of effective protections that filter these clicks automatically before impacting your budget.</p>
									<p>To protect its advertisers, Google carefully tracks the IP addresses of users that click ads. This ensures the platform quickly identifies unnatural behaviour that doesn't make sense for legitimate customers. Brands can also use the Google Ads platform to manually restrict certain IP addresses from viewing their ads. Plus, First Page Australia has in-depth fraud detection software that ensures we can locate fraudulent clicks to ensure this unethical behaviour doesn't hurt your campaign’s performance.</p>
